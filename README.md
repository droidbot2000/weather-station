# weather-station

We used a Raspberry Pi to collect data from a SparkFun HIH6130 temperature and relative humidity sensor using I2C, and a PiCamera to take a still photo of conditions in our outdoor discovery centre. The information is then tweeted out by our STEAM account, @lks_steam. The whole thing is powered by a sealed lead acid battery, charged by a solar panel and PWM solar charge controller.
