#hi students, let's use this file as an outline for the parts of our weather station code

#part 1 -- what do we need to setup before our code can run on a continuous loop?

#part 2 -- how will the weather station gather wind data?

#part 3 -- gather temperature and humidity data?

#part 4 -- gather soil moisture data?

#part 5 -- any other data?

#part 6 -- what do we do with the data?

#anything else?
